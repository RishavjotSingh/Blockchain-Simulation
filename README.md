# Blockchain-Simulation

- Developed a robust Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain simulation, leveraging SHA-256 cryptographic hashing and nonce discovery for secure block mining.
- Implemented PoW consensus mechanism to ensure transaction validity and order agreement among participants, ensuring a reliable and secure blockchain network.
- Implemented peer-to-peer network communication to maintain synchronization and facilitate consensus among the miners.
